# MediviaDistanceSimulator
A distance damage simulator for rangers in Medivia.
This will simulate damage like how to game would do it and then store all the data and give it back to the user.
With this data you can do all sorts of things, calculate your average damage, see your maximum hit and see the breakdown of the types of damages you did.

At this point this is a very incomplete project, I'm working on it every now and then in my free time.
If you have any suggestions, you can contact me through discord. I'm known as Diviton on the Official Medivia Discord.
